\description{
A tidy-format example dataset of laboratory analytical results used to
demonstrate data wrangling, unit handling, and quality-control workflows
for environmental monitoring data.
}
\details{
The dataset includes multiple analytes per sample, reported in long format,
along with sample metadata and laboratory result units.
